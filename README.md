# This is the Kameleon contributions repository

Kameleon was made to improve reproducibility and knowledge sharing. But, as
you can easily share your whole recipe, finding a particular steps can be
tricky because there was no central place to find some steps snippets.

**This repository is the place to share your Kameleon steps!**

It is also a good place to read some existing steps and learn from
examples and to share your experience and knowledge about Kameleon and
reproducible build in general.

The Kameleon will provides some steps but every users are encouraged to
share their experiences on the [wiki](https://github.com/oar-team/kameleon-contrib/wiki) or using issues and their code with
pull requests.

Pull requests are very welcomed :)
